            Hi there, nice to meet you.
            You can call me Shin, it's not really my name but it works for now. Lets see.. ok, let me tell you a bit about myself.
          </p>
          <p>I'm just a guy that likes to learn new things. Anything interesting will catch my attention and that was the case with coding.
          </p>
          <p>Naturally for people growing up in my generation, at least for the people I knew at the time, gaming was a big thing.
            I got interested in coding because of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was learning more about programming it became less and less about gaming and more about making tools for clients.
            It was like that in college and it remained the same at work.
            <q>Use this, this, and this to make x tool/program for this client.</q>
            This has its advantages if you want to practice those skills, but a lot of the times you would rather be doing and/or using something else.
            After a few years of web development using some relatively older tools (because the clients used that) I decided to just go and do my own thing with whatever tools I wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            This portfolio is the product of that need.
            I'm slowly catching up with the latest tools used in the market, hopefully I can develop anything I want after learning all that (including games, but making one of those things takes so much work! It will take some time).
          </p>
          <p>
            That's about it, thanks for reading!
